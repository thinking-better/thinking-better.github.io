A Q-Q plot is a graphical method for comparing the
distribution of observed data with a theoretical
distribution.

## What is the idea?

The basic idea is to compare corresponding quantiles
from two distributions.

If the two distributions have a similar shape, the
points tend to follow an approximately straight line.

## Why use Q-Q plots?

They are particularly useful for assessing whether data
are consistent with an assumed distribution.

For example, they are commonly used to assess whether
residuals are approximately normally distributed.

## What I look for

The important thing isn't simply whether every point lies
on the line.

I look for:

- systematic curvature
- changes in slope
- deviations in the tails
- isolated extreme observations

## My understanding

A Q-Q plot is best thought of as a comparison of
distributional shape rather than simply a test for
normality.
